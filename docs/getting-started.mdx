# Getting started
Welcome to **The IntuneCLI**. This CLI helps you managing Microsoft Intune environments.

## Installation
To use the IntuneCLI several installation options are available and can be use on Windows, MacOS and Linux.
In any way you first need to install at least `dotnet 7.0`. To install dotnet use the commands below.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

### Install dotnet 7 sdk
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
    winget install --id Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.7 --source winget --log C:\Temp\install.log
Check the link on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net70) for installing dotnet 7.0 on Windows.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
    Check the link on [Mircosoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/macos)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Restart the terminal or command prompt.

### NuGet
The recommended way to install this tool is with the use of the NuGet repository. Using the NuGet repository simplifies the download process. 
By using the install command below the correct package is selected automatically.  
Another advantage is using the NuGet installation method is that the command ```intuneCli``` becomes available in your whole system. 
You don't have to execute the specific file.

### Add the nuget feed
```
dotnet nuget add source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --name nuget.org
```

### This command will install the tool
```
dotnet tool install --global IntuneCLI
```

### Update to the latest version
```
dotnet tool update --global IntuneCLI
```

### Clear nuget cache (if the tool is not found)
It can happen that the update process does not find the latest package available on NuGet. In that case, you have to clear the local NuGet cache.
```
dotnet nuget locals all --clear
```

## Authenticate
Authentication is required to use the IntuneCLI but is simple. To Authenticate, just start using the commandlets. The first time you use a commandlet you will be asked to authenticate.
The authentication process will open a browser window where you can login with your Microsoft account. After login, you will be asked to give permission to the IntuneCLI to access your Microsoft environment.


## Help
If you need more information about all commands available use the `-h` option in a specific area.
Examples:

```shell
intuneCli -h
```
